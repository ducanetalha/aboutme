                             Ducane’s journey in education began in 2015, when he started teaching math and physics to his classmates. Even as a student, he developed unique teaching methods that were often more engaging than traditional classroom approaches. His classmates would turn to him for help and often found his explanations easier to understand than those of their teachers.

                             This early experience sparked his passion for education and led him to think about how learning could be made more fun and effective. Eventually, this interest evolved into designing educational games.

                             While in high school, Ducane participated in the TÜRGİM project, where he presented innovative ideas for reforming the education system. He even delivered a presentation about educational games to the Ministry of National Education of Turkey.

                             This passion later inspired Ducane’s decision to study Game Development and Design, with the goal of building educational tools that make learning more interactive and personalized.
